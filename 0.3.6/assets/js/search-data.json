For example, assuming an administrator has generated a device configuration and established a tunnel with local WireGuard address 10.3.2.2, the following ufw configuration would allow the administrator the ability to reach the Firezone web UI on the default 10.3.2.1 tunnel address for the server’s wg-firezone interface: . root@demo:~# ufw status verbose Status: active Logging: on (low) Default: deny (incoming), allow (outgoing), allow (routed) New profiles: skip To Action From -- ------ ---- 22/tcp ALLOW IN Anywhere 51820/udp ALLOW IN Anywhere Anywhere ALLOW IN 10.3.2.2 22/tcp (v6) ALLOW IN Anywhere (v6) 51820/udp (v6) ALLOW IN Anywhere (v6) .

In this case Firezone is acting as a network proxy or NAT gateway to provide a single public egress IP for all the devices connected to it. Step 1 - Deploy Firezone server . In this example, a Firezone instance has been set up on a tc2.micro EC2 instance. See the Deployment Guide for details on deploying Firezone. Specific to AWS, ensure: . | The security group of the Firezone EC2 instance allows outbound traffic to the IP of the protected resource. | An Elastic IP is associated with the Firezone instance. This will be the source IP address of traffic routed through the Firezone instance to external destinations. In this case the IP is 52.202.88.54. | . Step 2 - Restrict access to the protected resource . In this example, the protected resource is a self-hosted web app. Access to the web app is restricted to only requests from 52.202.88.54. Depending on the resource, inbound traffic on different ports and traffic types may need to be allowed. This is outside the scope of this guide. If the protected resource is controlled by a 3rd party, please inform the 3rd party to allow traffic from the static IP set in Step 1 (in this case 52.202.88.54). Step 3 - Route traffic to the protected resource through the VPN server . By default all traffic from users will be routed through the VPN server, and will originate from the static IP set in Step 1 (in this case 52.202.88.54). However, if split tunneling has been enabled, configuration may be required to ensure the destination IP of the protected resource is included in the Allowed IPs. Related: Authenticate . ",

This guide will walk through a simple example restricting access for a self-hosted web app to a single whitelisted static IP running Firezone.
