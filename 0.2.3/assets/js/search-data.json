Firezone consists of a single distributable Linux package that you install and manage yourself. Management of the Firezone installation is handled by the firezone-ctl utility while management of the VPN and firewall themselves are handled by the Web UI. Firezone acts as a frontend to both the WireGuard kernel module and netfilter kernel subsystem. It creates a WireGuard interface (by default called wg-firezone) and firezone netfilter table and adds appropriate routes to the routing table. Other programs that modify the Linux routing table or netfilter firewall may interfere with Firezone’s operation. SSL . Firezone requires a valid SSL certificate and a matching DNS record to run in production. We recommend using Let’s Encrypt to generate a free SSL cert for your domain. Security Considerations . Firezone is beta software. We highly recommend limiting network access to the Web UI (by default port tcp/443) to prevent exposing it to the public Internet. The WireGuard listen port (by default port udp/51821) should be exposed to allow user devices to connect. ",

This will initialize config files, set up needed services and generate the default configuration. | Edit the default configuration located at /etc/firezone/firezone.rb. At a minimum, you’ll need to review the following configuration variables: . # Auto-generated based on the server's hostname. # Set this to the FQDN used to access the Web UI. default['firezone']['fqdn'] = 'firezone.example.com' # ... # Specify the path to your SSL cert and private key. # If set to nil, a self-signed cert will be generated for you. default['firezone']['ssl']['certificate'] = '/path/to/cert.pem' default['firezone']['ssl']['certificate_key'] = '/path/to/key.pem' . | Reconfigure the application to pick up the new changes: sudo firezone-ctl reconfigure. | Finally, create an admin user with sudo firezone-ctl create-or-reset-admin.
